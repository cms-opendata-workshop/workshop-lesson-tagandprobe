>
> Welcome.  In this lesson you will:
> - Learn what Tag & Probe method is.
> - Plotting efficiency distributions for several variables using the Tag & Probe Method with data from ϒ (Upsilon) resonance decays to dimuons.
> - Learn two methods for performing signal extraction from a given dataset.
> - Learn how to use two efficiency measurement tools.
